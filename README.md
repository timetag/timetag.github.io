## Get Started!
### Install ETA

For a full installation, [Download](https://github.com/timetag/ETA/releases) and install GUI, backend and the ``ETA_LIB`` according to the [Documentation](https://eta.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html).

You can also try [ETA Web GUI](https://timetag.github.io/ETA/gui/src/renderer/) without installation.

### Recipies
Here are some [recipies](https://eta.readthedocs.io/en/latest/recipes.html) that could be used for your experiments.

We are also planning for a ðŸ“ŠðŸŽ‰[ETA Hub] which allows you to [download and share the recipie].
