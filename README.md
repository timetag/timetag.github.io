## What is time resolved measurements and how ETA can help you with that

Time resolved measurements are widely used for many research field, including

* Time correlated photon counting
* Fluorescence lifetime imaging
* Anti-bunching
* Linear optics quantum computing
* Quantum process tomography
* Scanning fluorescence microscopy
* Photo-activated localization microscopy (PALM)
* Stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM)
* Stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy

Depending on the duration of the experiments and frequency of events, time resolved measurements can easily generate huge amounts of data, which is overwhelming for common data analysis software.

We attempt to extract the useful information form data generated from time-resolved measurements by introducing a new kind of time-tag analysis software.

ETA, the extensible time tag analyzer, is an event driven programming language with graphical user interface for analyzing, plotting, and fitting of time tagged data.

## Get Started!
### Install ETA

For a full installation, [Download](https://github.com/timetag/ETA/releases) and install GUI, backend and the ``ETA_LIB`` according to the [Documentation](https://eta.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html).

You can also try [ETA Web GUI](https://timetag.github.io/ETA/gui/src/renderer/) without installation.

### Recipies
Check out the pre-made [recipies](https://eta.readthedocs.io/en/latest/recipes.html) ðŸŽ‰ that could be used immediately in your experiments.
